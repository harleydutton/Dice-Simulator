# Dice-Simulator
This app simulates and graphs the successes and passes over with varying numbers of dice for success-based dice systems.

## startup
```
git clone https://github.com/harleydutton/Dice-Simulator.git
cd Dice-Simulator
python -m pip install pandas matplotlib
python ./diceSim.py
```

## Plans
- The reactive elements feel bad. Make them accept the empty string.
- The booleans don't seem to be working. Investigate.
- Include some standard deviation info on graph2.
